Failover is a backup operational mode where a secondary system or component automatically takes over when the primary system fails or becomes unavailable. Think of it like having an understudy in a theater production - if the main actor can't perform, the understudy steps in to ensure the show goes on.

Key aspects of failover:

Redundancy: There's always at least one backup component ready to take over
Monitoring: The system continuously watches for failures in the primary component
Automatic switching: When a failure is detected, the system automatically switches to the backup
Minimal disruption: The goal is to maintain service with little to no downtime
Here's a real-world example: Many companies have two internet connections from different providers. If the primary connection fails, the network automatically switches (fails over) to the secondary connection, keeping the business online.

In the Redis example we discussed earlier, when the primary (master) Redis server fails, one of the replica servers automatically takes over as the new master, ensuring the cache service continues operating.

The term "failover" essentially means "switching over to a backup when a failure occurs" - it's a fundamental concept in creating reliable, highly-available systems.
