# Concepts

## Writing without Synchronization

## Multiversion Concurrenty Control (MVCC)
Allows multiple transactions to access different versions of data simultaneously without locking with Versioning, Snapshots, and Consistency. Allows high concurrency without locking by maintaining multiple versions of data.

## Read Committed vs. Serializable Isolation
Control the visibility of data changes across transactions, balancing performance and consistency.
