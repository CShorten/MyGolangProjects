# Concepts

## Writing without Synchronization

## Multiversion Concurrenty Control (MVCC)
Allows multiple transactions to access different versions of data simultaneously without locking with Versioning, Snapshots, and Consistency.

## Read Committed vs. Serializable Isolation
Control the visibility of data changes across transactions, balancing performance and consistency.
