In Python, methods defined within a class can be categorized into three types:

- Instance Methods: The most common type of method. These methods operate on an instance of the class and have access to the instance's attributes and methods. They receive self as the first parameter.

- Class Methods: These methods operate on the class itself rather than on instances of the class. They receive cls as the first parameter, which refers to the class.

- Static Methods: These methods do not receive an implicit first argument (self or cls). They behave like regular functions but are included within the class's namespace for logical grouping.

## Understanding Class Methods
Defined with @classmethod Decorator: To create a class method, you use the @classmethod decorator above the method definition.

First Parameter cls: The first parameter of a class method is cls, which refers to the class, not the instance.

Purpose: Class methods are often used for factory methods, which instantiate an instance of a class using alternative inputs or preprocessing.

Example of a Class Method:

```python
class MyClass:
    class_variable = "Hello"

    @classmethod
    def create_with_default(cls):
        return cls(class_variable=cls.class_variable)
```
