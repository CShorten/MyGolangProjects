The Experimental Free-threaded Mode in Python 3.13 represents a major step toward improving 
multi-threaded performance by removing the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). 
Traditionally, the GIL has been a limiting factor in Pythonâ€™s threading model, 
as it allows only one thread to execute Python bytecode at a time, even on multi-core systems. 
This new mode, when enabled, allows multiple threads to execute concurrently without the GIL, 
offering the potential for much better CPU-bound performance in multi-threaded applications.

Though still experimental and available only in select builds (Windows and macOS), 
this feature lays the groundwork for making Python more suitable for multi-core processors. 
It is particularly beneficial in scenarios like I/O-bound operations and parallel computations, 
where more concurrent execution can significantly improve overall performance.

This development is part of Python's long-term effort to enhance threading and concurrency
