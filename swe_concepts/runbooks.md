# Runbooks: Technical Operations Documentation

## Definition
A runbook is a standardized document containing technical procedures and operational instructions that detail how to handle routine operations, troubleshoot problems, and manage IT systems.

## Key Components
1. System Overview
   - Architecture diagrams
   - Dependencies
   - Critical components
   - Service Level Objectives (SLOs)

2. Standard Operating Procedures
   - Startup/shutdown sequences
   - Backup procedures
   - Maintenance tasks
   - Configuration changes

3. Troubleshooting Guides
   - Common failure scenarios
   - Diagnostic procedures
   - Resolution steps
   - Escalation paths

4. Emergency Response
   - Incident classification
   - Response procedures
   - Contact information
   - Recovery processes

## Best Practices
- Version control all runbooks
- Keep content current and accurate
- Use clear, step-by-step instructions
- Include validation checkpoints
- Document prerequisites
- Maintain change history

## Types of Runbooks
1. Manual Runbooks
   - Human-readable instructions
   - Step-by-step guidance
   - Decision trees

2. Automated Runbooks
   - Scripted procedures
   - Infrastructure as Code
   - Automated remediation
   - Monitoring integration

3. Semi-Automated Runbooks
   - Combined manual/automated steps
   - Human verification points
   - Hybrid workflows

## Benefits
- Reduced Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR)
