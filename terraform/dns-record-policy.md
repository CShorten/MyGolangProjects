# DNS Record Management Policies with Terraform

## Overview
This document outlines best practices and policies for managing DNS records using Terraform. These guidelines ensure consistent, secure, and maintainable DNS infrastructure across cloud environments.

## Record Creation and Naming Conventions

### Resource Naming
DNS records in Terraform should follow a standardized naming convention:
- Use lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens
- Prefix record names with the environment (e.g., prod-, dev-, stage-)
- Include the record type in the resource name
- Example: `resource "aws_route53_record" "prod-api-a-record"`

### Record Types
Each record type requires specific validation and configuration:

A Records:
- Must specify IPv4 addresses in standard format
- Include TTL (Time To Live) values between 300-3600 seconds
- Document any geo-routing or latency-based routing decisions

CNAME Records:
- Cannot be created at zone apex
- Must point to fully-qualified domain names
- Avoid CNAME chains exceeding 2 levels

MX Records:
- Include priority values
- Reference valid mail server hostnames
- Document spam protection measures (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)

## Security Policies

### Access Control
- Implement strict IAM policies for DNS management
- Restrict zone transfer capabilities
- Enable audit logging for all DNS changes
- Require multi-factor authentication for critical zone modifications

### Change Management
```hcl
resource "aws_route53_zone" "primary" {
  name = "example.com"
  
  lifecycle {
    prevent_destroy = true
  }
  
  tags = {
    Environment = "Production"
    ManagedBy   = "Terraform"
    Owner       = "Infrastructure Team"
  }
}
```

### Validation Requirements
- Implement mandatory tags for all DNS resources
- Require documentation for all record changes
- Enforce version control for all Terraform configurations
- Maintain change history with detailed commit messages

## High Availability and Disaster Recovery

### Redundancy
- Configure secondary DNS providers where critical
- Implement automated health checks for critical records
- Maintain backup zones in separate regions

### Monitoring
```hcl
resource "aws_route53_health_check" "primary" {
  fqdn              = "api.example.com"
  port              = 443
  type              = "HTTPS"
  failure_threshold = "3"
  request_interval  = "30"
  
  tags = {
    Name = "Primary API Health Check"
  }
}
```

## Compliance and Documentation

### Record Documentation
Each DNS record should include:
- Purpose and service description
- Contact information for responsible team
- Related application or service dependencies
- Compliance requirements or restrictions

### Mandatory Tags
```hcl
locals {
  common_tags = {
    Environment = var.environment
    Project     = var.project_name
    ManagedBy   = "Terraform"
    Owner       = var.team_email
    LastUpdated = timestamp()
  }
}
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### Module Structure
- Create reusable modules for common record patterns
- Separate environments using workspaces or separate state files
- Implement consistent variable naming across modules

### State Management
- Store state files in secure, versioned backends
- Implement state locking to prevent concurrent modifications
- Regular backup of state files
- Document state recovery procedures

## Validation and Testing

### Pre-deployment Checks
- Validate record syntax and formatting
- Check for naming convention compliance
- Verify absence of duplicate records
- Confirm proper TTL values

### Post-deployment Verification
- Automated DNS resolution testing
- Latency measurements for critical records
- Certificate validation for SSL/TLS endpoints
- Regular security scanning

## Change Control Process

### Required Approvals
1. Technical review of proposed changes
2. Security team approval for public-facing records
3. Documentation review
4. Change advisory board sign-off for production changes

### Implementation Process
1. Development environment testing
2. Staging environment verification
3. Production deployment window scheduling
4. Rollback procedure documentation

## Maintenance and Updates

### Regular Reviews
- Quarterly audit of all DNS records
- Review of TTL values and optimization
- Cleanup of deprecated records
- Update of documentation and contacts

### Performance Optimization
- Regular latency monitoring
- TTL optimization based on usage patterns
- Geographic distribution analysis
- Cache hit rate monitoring
